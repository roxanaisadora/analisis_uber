# Uber app review

From this analysis, the extraction and definition of the objects, classes and methods that make up the application was carried out, UML was used to model it and, finally, using different languages such as Java, JS, PHP and Python, the implementation of the classes was carried out. and application objects.

## Diagrama UML

### In POO there are 5 fundamental things:
-------------

* Class: They are the most generic mold and from which we can instantiate many objects.

* Objects: They are created from classes and have data and functionality.

* Attributes: They are the specific characteristics of the object (They are the variables within the code).

* Methods: These are the functions or actions that this object can do.

* Installing: It is the creation of an object from a class that is called an instance or instances.

### The pillars of POO are:
-------------

* Abstraction: It is to separate each one of the data of an object to be able to create its mold (class)

* Encapsulation: It is to isolate a data so that it is private and cannot be seen or modified.

* Inheritance: It is creating one or more classes from a class that already exists. And they are called subclasses.

* Polyomorphism: It is building methods with the same name but with different behavior.
